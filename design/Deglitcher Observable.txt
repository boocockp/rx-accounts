Deglitcher Observable
================

Constructing the tree with intermediate DeglitcherObservables
--------------------------------------------------------
- Create one around any normal observable
- Wrap all functions that return an observable to return a Deglitcher observable around original one
- DeglitcherObservable needs to extend Observable so it can "be" one and so can call superclass implementations to wrap them
- Need to call superclass function, so that next observable eg FilterObservable, points to the DeglitcherObservable, then wrap that in another DeglitcherObservable
- Like return new DeglitcherObservable(super.map(...args)) - do with ES6
- Override subscribe()?  All observables must go through that - yes? But prob want to do in subscribe function anyway
- Can you use Defer for this?

Knowing when an operation finished
----------------------------------

- Would be good if could ask any CO to tell you when it is done
- May need to ask initial CO in chain to tell you
- CO could know about its parents and its children if choose to store that when constructing the tree
- CO wrapper functions would have to examine incoming args to see which were parent COs
- COs could have path to each other from top to bottom of tree, bypassing the actual data observables
- CO basically knows when onNext called by its source - when some data is sent down the tree
- CO knows when it calls onNext on each of its subscribers
- May need to ask for cooperation from some types of function with variable number of emitted values - but this is a burden
- Maybe a variable number of emitted values is always a stream

Problems
--------
- Filter - don't know whether a value will be sent immediately
- Async - don't know whether a value will be sent in future
- Expand functions - don't know how many values will be sent
- Two types of glitch - race condition within Rx and async timing issues

Possible mechanisms
-------------------
- Notify downstream a value coming - but what if don't know how many?
- Notify upstream that a value is received
- Pre-notification: Notify all downstream COs there are 0 or more values being sent, and again when done - if functions cooperate
  - Each downstream CO knows how many potential updates it is waiting for
- A CO that gets data without pre-notification knows it is start of chain
- CO at start of chain could assign tran id if useful
- Multiple transactions could be affecting one downstream CO at same time
- Post notification:

- Could also send control info down normal channel and filter it out
- Big snag is: how do you know when an Rx observable has finished its reaction to onNext?
- Everything has to be a stream, or coerced to a stream
- Have a new set of operators that produce and deal with framed streams?

Knowing when an Rx observable onNext has finished
-------------------------------------------------
- We don't care about observables that only work when stream completes
- Filter, map, scan, combineLatest are important
- Frame the actual data with start and end values
- Use the Observable contract with flatMap to guarantee ordering
- Treat each value as a stream and feed it to the Observable so get onComplete
- Wrap map and predicate functions to always pass through control values
- Scheduling still ends up calling the next function synchronously
- Assumption: if a simple next function hasn't called onNext by the time it returns, it isn't going to
- Is it even legal to implement an observable to call onNext asynchronously?
- A real async function has to return a stream, not a value - true?
- Flatmap needs to be used to get stream values back into normal stream

Getting the value out
---------------------
- Poss: normal subscribers get the actual value, so subscribe with function or Subject gets value out of deglitcher

Wrapper Deglitcher
------------------

- Maintains normal use of any observable
- Could extend to wrapping async streams - this should be optional

Root Deglitcher
---------------
- Wraps the original source for subscribers
- Wraps methods that return observables to return WrapperDeglitchers
- Has a single control observable that is returned by a glitchControl() function
- When receives onNext, emits Start to control obs, calls main OnNext, emits End to control Obs

Wrapper Deglitcher
------------------
- Wraps a parent deglitcher for subscribers
- Wraps methods that return observables to return WrapperDeglitchers
- Has a wrapped Observable with the wrapper as its source
- Has an observer subscribed to the wrapped Observable
- Creates subscriber observers for each subscribe call
- Has a single control observable that is returned by a glitchControl() function
- When receives control Start, increments its expected values count, passes on start to control observers
- When receives onNext:
  - calls onNext on the wrapped Observable
  - saves anything output in the wrapper observer
- When receives control End:
  - decrements expected values count
  - if expected values is zero,
        - copies the output to its subscriber observers
        - sends control End

Inline Deglitcher
-----------------
- If it is talking to a Deglitcher, passes on control messages, otherwise only main

Observables and Observers
-------------------------
- Observables (-able = capability) describe the possible pipeline, have refs towards the source
- Observers (-er = doing) are instances of a pipeline, have refs towards subscriber
- One instance of observer for each subscription to an observable
- If have a diamond structure below an observable and two subscribers at end, there will be 4 observers - true?
- These will be in two pairs, one for each end subscriber
- Each pair needs to track separately when it is ready
