Notes
=====

- find function
- scan function

- keep latest idea - transactions, accounts
  - may involve a map or database underneath
- need to be able to delete and/or deactivate ref entities used in old transactions but no longer used

- symbol for DR/CR
- object for balance - decimal plus DR/CR

- save filter streams in obj, return in getter
- cache streams with subject

- VAT rate is an event with date when came into effect

- Bookkeeping event and transaction with postings are different things
- May apply a rule or an ad-hoc posting interpretation to each event
- Rule definitions are ref data inputs
- Applications of rules to events to produce transactions are additional inputs

- BehaviorSubjects: don't scatter them around for no reason

- Work out how to use async/await with Rx

Patterns
--------
- look for patterns for scanning and saving
- running total
- running list
- running set of ids
- denormalize with chosen items from parent
- extract set of properties
- extract set of properties into combineLatest
- add id to incoming event
- add id to new mutable object eg account - need to replay after adding ids
- add id to new immutable event eg transaction
- streams within streams, or changing set of changing sets:
   - stream producing lists of streams, combine latest across all streams, then switch,  to produce list of values eg account balances in trial balance

Development approach
--------------------
- Streams of streams eg in trial balance are very difficult to understand
- Streams of lists, with map on each, are difficult
- Hiding the fact that something is a stream and is being mapped may help
- How do you name streams? After the value in each event?  Singular or plural?
- Can you treat fixed lists and streams within a value as equivalent? Eg transaction postings with flatMap

Using streams in view components
--------------------------------
- Adapter component to take stream and convert to readOnly property with notify
- May be two levels eg to get account ids and names
- May need to have component to surface account name list, like TrialBalance.accountBalances, but uses details instead of summary

ToDo
----
- Work out publish and replay and share to avoid messing with Subjects
